This is for things I need to fix, or what I plan on doing in the future. Will be used mostly for the public release, so others know what could be coming (and if I need help with it, I probably will).

# Upcoming additions
1. More of a vanilla playthrough (rebalancing content, adding in linear progression enemy, item, and boss-wise) so this is less of a dev playground and instead an actual playable mod.
2. More commissioned (or donated) sprites for better looking items.
3. Additions to post-moonlord, including bosses, items, and NPCs.
4. A possible story? (most likely after adding all things previously mentioned.)

## Todo/Current bugs
All things listed are bugs in whatever newest update this is on.

1. Sister Of Steel NPC has bug in walking animation, and needs an attack animation with her weapon.
2. Change the green trail on the Lahat Chereb projectile so it isn't an obvious clone of the chlorophyte bullet.
3. Cryolisis randomly does like a billion damage for no reason on contact and instantly kills the player, I have no idea why.
