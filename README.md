# CURRENTLY UPDATED TO 1.4 BUT THERE ARE STILL ISSUES, I have no idea what i'm doing and until there is an official release the code may not work. Some features have been currently disabled/reworked as a temporary fix, I'm still learning how to use IEntity source and for some reason I just cannot figure it out (so Cryolisis is completely gone ATM and modded NPC drops are wack.)

**Your Tale**- A Terraria mod thing I update weekly-ish, and completely open for you to use!
This might be broken sometimes so i would get this from the official Tmod site so you can update it a lot easier, untill version 1.5 official release it might not work a lot.
## This currently includes:
1. Custom world generation, currently supports ore generation and will soon support custom structures and loot placement.
2. A couple weapon types, such as lots of different staffs and whatnot.
3. a couple custom mobs and 1 boss, all with varying AIs to mess around with.
4. Custom prefixes, obtainable in normal play.
5. LOTS of custom projectiles.

This mod is not really meant to be played normally, as there are probably unbalanced features and not a lot of time worth playing with.

Lots of love to:
* Tmodloader, and their example mod for helping me grasp the basics of modding terraria.
* FoolsLynx, for getting me intrested in this whole mess.
* The DRGN mod developer/s for providing an open sourced mod with lots of neat content aswell, that really helped me through harder coding times.
* Calamity mod for buttloads of inspiration.
* And you, for reading this much!

I hope you can enjoy this mod as much as I enjoyed coding it. -Quidd
