**Your Tale**- A Terraria mod thing I update weekly-ish, and completely open for you to use!
Cloning straight from this github and not downloading it from the releases tab (or from TmodLoader's official mod downloader) may result in some bugs or errors, so I would recommend looking into either previously mentioned option.

## This currently includes:
1. Custom world generation, currently supports ore generation and will soon support custom structures and loot placement.
2. Over 29 weapons, with at least one of every type supported in vanilla terraria.
3. a couple custom mobs and 1 boss.
4. Custom prefixes, obtainable in normal play.
5. And of course new features every update!

If you're reading this, then this mod is not currently updated to play in a vanilla playthrough. I hope to implement a vanilla-like playstyle by update 1.5.

Lots of love to:
* Tmodloader, and their example mod for helping me grasp the basics of modding terraria.
* FoolsLynx, for getting me intrested in this whole mess.
* The DRGN mod developer/s for providing an open sourced mod with lots of neat content aswell, that really helped me through harder coding times.
* Calamity mod for buttloads of inspiration.
* And you, for reading this much!

I hope you can enjoy this mod as much as I enjoyed coding it. -Quidd
